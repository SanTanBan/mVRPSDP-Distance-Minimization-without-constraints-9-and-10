The Python File "Formulation without 9 and 10 with Paper Input.py" and the Excel File "Input_Data.xlsx" need to be kept in the same folder without anything else.

After that running the Python file will automatically create the requisite Tables, Folders, Text Files for the Routes as well as create the Image files.

The Python Program may be run as long as possible and terminated at will. All solutions are saved and termination of the program any-time manually is allowed.
